**TRELLIS.2** is a state-of-the-art large 3D generative model (4B parameters) designed for high-fidelity **image-to-3D** generation. It leverages a novel "field-free" sparse voxel structure termed **O-Voxel** to reconstruct and generate arbitrary 3D assets with complex topologies, sharp features, and full PBR materials.


## ✨ Features

### 1. High Quality, Resolution & Efficiency
Our 4B-parameter model generates high-resolution fully textured assets with exceptional fidelity and efficiency using vanilla DiTs. It utilizes a Sparse 3D VAE with 16× spatial downsampling to encode assets into a compact latent space.

| Resolution | Total Time* | Breakdown (Shape + Mat) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **512³** | **~3s** | 2s + 1s |
| **1024³** | **~17s** | 10s + 7s |
| **1536³** | **~60s** | 35s + 25s |

<small>*Tested on NVIDIA H100 GPU.</small>

### 2. Arbitrary Topology Handling
The **O-Voxel** representation breaks the limits of iso-surface fields. It robustly handles complex structures without lossy conversion:
*   ✅ **Open Surfaces** (e.g., clothing, leaves)
*   ✅ **Non-manifold Geometry**
*   ✅ **Internal Enclosed Structures**

### 3. Rich Texture Modeling
Beyond basic colors, TRELLIS.2 models arbitrary surface attributes including **Base Color, Roughness, Metallic, and Opacity**, enabling photorealistic rendering and transparency support.

### 4. Minimalist Processing
Data processing is streamlined for instant conversions that are fully **rendering-free** and **optimization-free**.
*   **< 10s** (Single CPU): Textured Mesh → O-Voxel
*   **< 100ms** (CUDA): O-Voxel → Textured Mesh


## 🔧 Fork Changes

This fork includes the following modifications:

### Interactive Control Script
A new `trellis.sh` script provides a menu-driven interface to manage the Gradio app:
```bash
./trellis.sh
```
Options: Start app, Stop app, Check status, Exit

### GPU Memory Optimizations
- **Auto-cleanup**: Automatically kills non-essential GPU processes before heavy operations
- **OOM Retry Logic**: Automatic fallbacks on out-of-memory errors (disables remeshing, reduces decimation)
- **Aggressive Tensor Cleanup**: Frees intermediate tensors during pipeline execution

### Extended Feature Extractors
- Added `DinoV3ConvNextFeatureExtractor` class for DINOv3 ConvNeXt models
- Configurable image sizes for DINOv2 feature extraction

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- **System**: The code is currently tested only on **Linux**.
- **Hardware**: An NVIDIA GPU with at least 24GB of memory is necessary. The code has been verified on NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs.  
- **Software**:   
  - The [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) is needed to compile certain packages. Recommended version is 12.4.  
  - [Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/#quick-command-line-install) is recommended for managing dependencies.  
  - Python version 3.8 or higher is required. 

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone -b main https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS.2.git --recursive
    cd TRELLIS.2
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    
    **Before running the following command there are somethings to note:**
    - By adding `--new-env`, a new conda environment named `trellis2` will be created. If you want to use an existing conda environment, please remove this flag.
    - By default the `trellis2` environment will use pytorch 2.6.0 with CUDA 12.4. If you want to use a different version of CUDA, you can remove the `--new-env` flag and manually install the required dependencies. Refer to [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) for the installation command.
    - If you have multiple CUDA Toolkit versions installed, `CUDA_HOME` should be set to the correct version before running the command. For example, if you have CUDA Toolkit 12.4 and 13.0 installed, you can run `export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12.4` before running the command.
    - By default, the code uses the `flash-attn` backend for attention. For GPUs do not support `flash-attn` (e.g., NVIDIA V100), you can install `xformers` manually and set the `ATTN_BACKEND` environment variable to `xformers` before running the code. See the [Minimal Example](#minimal-example) for more details.
    - The installation may take a while due to the large number of dependencies. Please be patient. If you encounter any issues, you can try to install the dependencies one by one, specifying one flag at a time.
    - If you encounter any issues during the installation, feel free to open an issue or contact us.
    
    Create a new conda environment named `trellis2` and install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    . ./setup.sh --new-env --basic --flash-attn --nvdiffrast --nvdiffrec --cumesh --o-voxel --flexgemm
    ```
    The detailed usage of `setup.sh` can be found by running `. ./setup.sh --help`.
    ```sh
    Usage: setup.sh [OPTIONS]
    Options:
        -h, --help              Display this help message
        --new-env               Create a new conda environment
        --basic                 Install basic dependencies
        --flash-attn            Install flash-attention
        --cumesh                Install cumesh
        --o-voxel               Install o-voxel
        --flexgemm              Install flexgemm
        --nvdiffrast            Install nvdiffrast
        --nvdiffrec             Install nvdiffrec
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Image to 3D Generation

#### Minimal Example

Here is an [example](example.py) of how to use the pretrained models for 3D asset generation.

```python
import os
os.environ['OPENCV_IO_ENABLE_OPENEXR'] = '1'
os.environ["PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF"] = "expandable_segments:True"  # Can save GPU memory
import cv2
import imageio
from PIL import Image
import torch
from trellis2.pipelines import Trellis2ImageTo3DPipeline
from trellis2.utils import render_utils
from trellis2.renderers import EnvMap
import o_voxel

# 1. Setup Environment Map
envmap = EnvMap(torch.tensor(
    cv2.cvtColor(cv2.imread('assets/hdri/forest.exr', cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED), cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB),
    dtype=torch.float32, device='cuda'
))

# 2. Load Pipeline
pipeline = Trellis2ImageTo3DPipeline.from_pretrained("microsoft/TRELLIS.2-4B")
pipeline.cuda()

# 3. Load Image & Run
image = Image.open("assets/example_image/T.png")
mesh = pipeline.run(image)[0]
mesh.simplify(16777216) # nvdiffrast limit

# 4. Render Video
video = render_utils.make_pbr_vis_frames(render_utils.render_video(mesh, envmap=envmap))
imageio.mimsave("sample.mp4", video, fps=15)

# 5. Export to GLB
glb = o_voxel.postprocess.to_glb(
    vertices            =   mesh.vertices,
    faces               =   mesh.faces,
    attr_volume         =   mesh.attrs,
    coords              =   mesh.coords,
    attr_layout         =   mesh.layout,
    voxel_size          =   mesh.voxel_size,
    aabb                =   [[-0.5, -0.5, -0.5], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]],
    decimation_target   =   1000000,
    texture_size        =   4096,
    remesh              =   True,
    remesh_band         =   1,
    remesh_project      =   0,
    verbose             =   True
)
glb.export("sample.glb", extension_webp=True)
```

Upon execution, the script generates the following files:
 - `sample.mp4`: A video visualizing the generated 3D asset with PBR materials and environmental lighting.
 - `sample.glb`: The extracted PBR-ready 3D asset in GLB format.

**Note:** The `.glb` file is exported in `OPAQUE` mode by default. Although the alpha channel is preserved within the texture map, it is not active initially. To enable transparency, import the asset into your 3D software and manually connect the texture's alpha channel to the material's opacity or alpha input.

#### Web Demo

[app.py](app.py) provides a simple web demo for image to 3D asset generation. you can run the demo with the following command:
```sh
python app.py
```

Then, you can access the demo at the address shown in the terminal.
